Please read below carefully before contacting me for a possible supervision request. 


1. **Are you accepting PhD students?**
Yes. 

2. **Do you have PhD scholarship/funding to support me?**
Opportunity generally comes and goes. But I will surely advertise the studentship widely. Otherwise, you have to seek your own funding or sponsorship (e.g. family, government, industry, etc.), which is very common in the U.K., particularly for international students. If you are a Chinese, you may consider the [China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scholarship](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/funding/348). 

3. **I am self-funded. Will you accept me straightaway?**
Being self-funded does not mean that you get the PhD offer and can straightway work with me. Your suitability should be assessed as usual such as education and research background.  

4. **How can I work with you for a self-funded PhD?**
 * Please check my profile to identify if your research interests closely align with mine.
 * Send me your detailed CV and a short research proposal.
 * Wait for my response.
 * If you do not receive my response within a week, perhaps you have randomly sent me your application without even checking my profile. 

5. **Can I still apply without contacting you?**
Yes, you can, but this is not encouraged. 

6. **What are my minimum entry requirements?**
Selection will be made on the basis of academic merit. Candidates should have (or expect to achieve) a UK honours degree at 2.1 or above (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Systems Engineering, Automation or equivalent experience. 

7. **How much will it cost me**
Please check [online](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/international/finance.php)

8. **What is the application procedure for self-funded PhD**
  * Formal applications: check [How to Apply](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/how-to-apply-1639.php) and then completed [online](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/pgap/login.php)
  * Apply for Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computing Science
  * State name of the lead supervisor (Jinya Su) as the Name of Proposed Supervisor
  * State ‘Self-funded’ as Intended Source of Funding
  * State the exact project title on the application form
  * When applying please ensure all required documents are attached: All degree certificates and transcripts (Undergraduate AND Postgraduate MSc-officially translated into English where necessary); Detailed CV, Personal Statement and Intended source of funding.
  * Informal inquiries can be made to me (jinya.su@abdn.ac.uk) with a copy of your curriculum vitae and cover letter. All general enquiries should be directed to the Postgraduate Research School (pgrs-admissions@abdn.ac.uk)

9. **Do you accept short-term interns?**
No. 

10. **Do you accept visiting students or visiting scholars?**
Yes. Please feel free to contact me if you want to visit me. But this is generally self-funded. 

11. **I want an acceptance letter to apply for a scholarhsip, can you please give me one?**
NO. The correct procedure is to apply to our PhD programme, pass the interview if shortlisted, and based on your performance in your interview, you will be offered an acceptance letter or not. I can NOT just recommend you for a place bypassing all formal requirements.

12. **What is like by working with you?**
  * You are free to explore the research topic widely and responsibly.
  * A chance to work with my collaborative network both nationally and internationally.
  * I will help you in disseminating your research findings in top publication venues. 
  * I will offer you suitable part-time research associate position via the research funding.


13. **Who is an ideal PhD student in your eyes?**
  * Well motivated 
  * Ready to learn 
  * Dedicated
  * Responsible
